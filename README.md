# retropie_saves
Want to play a local multiplayer game but don't want to unlock all the levels, characters, etc.? Download these pre-made game saves so you can experience the full local multiplayer experience!

Just make sure the save games match the ROM files that you are using! 

Be aware that not all of the naming conventions are the same, I would like have them all named with the "Re-dump" naming convention [Game Title (USA/Europe/Japan/etc)] but I haven't had time to do this.

These are mainly focused on multiplayer objects or other unlockables such as mini-games.
Games such as RPG saves will not be included, because you should just play and enjoy the games! There are a few exceptions, such as games like Resident Evil 2 saves where Hunk and Tofu are unlocked, so if you want to play the campaign with those characters you can.

These are mostly USA versions of games because for a lot of cases they are the ones you should be playing due to NTSC generally being better than the PAL versions (although i'm sure there are exceptions).

MURICA!
